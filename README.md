# To-Do List
A simple CRUD app using firebase with drag and drop functionality that makes API calls to a node server using a MySQL database to GET, POST, UPDATE and DELETE todos

It wont work for you because the server is made to only respond to requests from my website and i have secured my MySQL database. So use this as an example or for reference as you will need to make multiple changes for it to work
